## 1. Playback Controls

The playback controls are located at the bottom of the application window.

* **Play/Pause:** The central button with the play ($\blacktriangleright$) or pause ($\pause$) icon toggles the playback of the currently selected song.
* **Next/Previous Track:** The buttons with the next ($\blacktriangleright\!\!\!\!\blacktriangleright$) and previous ($\blacktriangleleft\!\!\!\!\blacktriangleleft$) icons allow you to navigate to the next or previous song in the playlist, respectively.
* **Shuffle:** The shuffle button ($\shuffle$) randomizes the order in which songs from the playlist are played.
* **Repeat:** The repeat button ($\repeat$) allows you to loop the current song. Toggling this button cycles through repeating the single song or disabling the repeat.
* **Progress Bar:** The horizontal bar with the current playback time (e.g., `0:08`) and total duration (e.g., `4:44`) allows you to see the current position in the song. You can click or drag the indicator on the bar to jump to a specific point in the track.
* **Volume Control:** The speaker icon (:loud_sound:) and the slider next to it control the volume of the audio output. You can adjust the volume by dragging the slider. Clicking the speaker icon will mute (:mute:)or unmute the audio.

## 2. Playlist Management

The playlist is displayed in the left section of the application window.

* **Viewing the Playlist:** The list shows all the songs that are currently loaded into the player. You can scroll through the list to see all available tracks.
* **Selecting a Song:** To play a specific song, simply click on its title in the playlist. The selected song will be highlighted (e.g., "Black Eyed Peas - Meet Me Halfway" in the screenshot) and playback will begin (or resume if paused).
* **Changing the Playlist Order:** To change the order of the playlist, simply drag that needs to be moved and drop it in a desired location.

## 3. Lyrics Display

The lyrics for the currently playing song are displayed in the right section of the application window.

* As the song plays, the lyrics can be viewed and scrolled down to show more (this feature may depend on the availability of lyrics for the specific song).

## 4. Equalizer

The equalizer controls are located in the middle section of the application window.

* **Bass:** Use the slider next to "Bass" to adjust the intensity of the low-frequency sounds in the music. Moving the slider to the right increases the bass, while moving it to the left decreases it.
* **Mid:** Use the slider next to "Mid" to adjust the intensity of the mid-frequency sounds in the music.
* **Treble:** Use the slider next to "Treble" to adjust the intensity of the high-frequency sounds in the music.

By adjusting these sliders, you can customize the audio output to your preference.
